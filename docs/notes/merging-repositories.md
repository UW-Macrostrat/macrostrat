In November 2023, we merged several repositories to this one, maintaining the
commit history. These repositories were then archived.

- [UW-Macrostrat/map-integration](https://UW-Macrostrat/map-integration)
  (formerly `UW-Macrostrat/burwell`) had no un-merged commits.
- [UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat-utils](https://UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat-utils) had a
  few un-merged commits, but they were from 2018 and are now irrelevant.
- [UW-Macrostrat/infrastructure](https://UW-Macrostrat/infrastructure) had a few
  un-merged branches, which were extracted as diffs and applied to this
  repository.

It would have been better to save un-merged commits all at once, by giving the
commits branch names and then merging them all at once. However, we failed to do
this, and instead merged them one at a time.
