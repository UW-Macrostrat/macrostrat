# Ad-hoc SQL scripts

This directory contains ad-hoc SQL scripts that can be run on demand.
These scripts aren't yet structured well enough to be included in the
main codebase, but they are useful for one-off tasks.

Ideally, these should eventually be integrated into data maintenance scripts
or migrations.
