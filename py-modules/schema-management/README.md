# Macrostrat schema management utilities

This module contains utilities for managing Macrostrat's database schema.
It includes tools for dealing with both a stateless, diff-based schema migration
approach and stateful tools for handling specific schema changes that need to occur.

See the [`schema`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat/tree/main/schema) directory for more information.

## Composition

The declarative schema is assembled from **chunks** (`macrostrat.core.SchemaDefinition`)
ordered by a dependency graph, rather than by filename:

- `chunks.py` — the explicit list of chunks and their `depends_on` edges. Each
  chunk `provides` a `.sql` directory, a single file, or a function (e.g. the
  colocated `TopologySchema`).
- `composer.py` — `build_schema(db, env, target=…)` topologically sorts and applies
  chunks. `target` is a **subsystem/chunk name**; only that chunk and its
  transitive dependencies are built.
- `test_harness.py` — `DatabaseTestHarness` builds progressively, chunk by chunk,
  skipping already-applied chunks, with an `optimize` transform for fast test builds.

`macrostrat schema graph` lists the chunks and order; `macrostrat schema provision [TARGET]`
builds them.

## Other capabilities

- **Two migration models.** A stateless, diff-based flow (`macrostrat schema plan` / `apply`,
  backed by `migra`) reconciles structure against the composed ideal; stateful `Migration`
  classes (`macrostrat schema migrate`) handle transitions the diff can't express — renames,
  backfills, data-dependent changes — gated by pre/postconditions.
- **`rebuild_views`** re-applies views as code: `CREATE OR REPLACE` by default, dropping and
  recreating (and restoring grants) only when a signature change requires it, via the
  `macrostrat.database` `on_error` recovery hook. Views, functions, and triggers otherwise
  stay diff-managed (migra sequences their drop/recreate around dependent table changes).
- **Enforced read-only access** (`readonly.py`) — `readonly_login` mints an ephemeral,
  privilege-limited login role (`pg_read_all_data` plus optional impersonation roles) so tests
  against a live database genuinely cannot write; `assert_read_only` fails closed, and
  `as_role` runs reads as a specific role for grant / RLS testing.
- **Testing** — `DatabaseTestHarness` builds schema progressively; a drift test asserts the
  declarative build has an empty `plan` against its own freshly-built ideal.

## Direction

The composer is in place, but the reorientation to fully modular subsystems is **not finished**.
Intended next steps:

- **Colocate** each subsystem's `.sql` with its owning module (as `map-topology` already does
  with `TopologySchema`), and *discover* chunks rather than listing them centrally in `chunks.py`.
- **Decompose `core`** (today `public → macrostrat → core`-remainder) into finer named subsystems
  with real `depends_on` edges.
- **Unify migrations into the chunk graph** so a `SchemaDefinition` owns both its declarative
  providers and its condition-gated `Migration`s — a subsystem's structure, transitions, and seed
  data in one place.
- **Template-database isolation** for faster, hermetic test databases.
