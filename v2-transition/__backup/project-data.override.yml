# Paleomacro project data customizations
# 
# This file can be modified in order to customize the project data for installed project
# pieces. For each project piece whose attributes you wish to override, create an entry
# under 'piece:' below and include just those attributes you wish to override. All other
# attributes of each piece will be left unchanged.
#
# You should do all such customizations here, and leave the original project-data.yml
# files untouched. Otherwise, you will interfere with keeping the git repositories for
# the project pieces up-to-date.
