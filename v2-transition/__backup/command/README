The Paleobiology Database - command-line control script
=======================================================

This project installs an update and control command for the Paleobiology Database
server and/or the Macrostrat server in their Dockerized forms.

INSTALLATION:

To install this script, type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

DEPENDENCIES

This script uses nothing but core modules, plus YAML::Tiny which is installed by
default on both Mac OSX, Debian, and Ubuntu.

ABSTRACT

The installation procedure installs the two commands `pbdb' and `macrostrat'. To
get a list of available subcommands, type the following:

  pbdb help

The paleobiodb files are by default assumed to be located in
/var/paleobiodb. This can be overridden either during installation or at runtime
by setting the environment variable PALEOBIODB_PATH to the desired directory path.

You can also override the docker-config file by specifying a path name (relative to the 
paleobiodb directory) in the environment variable PALEOBIODB_CONFIG.
