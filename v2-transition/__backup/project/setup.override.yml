# Paleobiology Database file tree customizations
# 
# This file can be modified in order to customize the Paleobiology Database file tree definitions
# for this particular installation.
# 
# Any changes to file tree setup actions should be made here, and NOT in setup.yml.
# 

# To override the action specified in setup.yml for any particular path, add an entry to the list
# below specifying the same path. If you simply want to cancel the action for that path, set the
# type to 'skip'. Otherwise, whatever type and other attributes you set will be used to generate
# an action for that path, and the attributes specified in setup.yml will be completely ignored.
# You can also add entries with paths that do not appear in setup.yml. These actions will be
# carried out after the ones specified in setup.yml.

# The following types are available:
# 
#    skip                  Do nothing to the specified path, and skip any action specified
#                             for that path in setup.yml. The only required attribute is 'path'.
#    
#    repository         Clone a git repository from the URL specified by the 'source' option
#                             to the specified path. The attribute 'source' is required. If the
#                             source URL is not absolute, it will be appended to the remote URL
#                             for the base repository minus the last component. If you want to
#                             override this, you can provide a different base using the 'git_remote'
#                             keyword at the top level of this file.
#    
#    dir                     Create a directory with the specified path.
#    
#    symlink             Create a symlink from the specified path to the specified target. The
#                             attribute 'target' is required.

# An example entry has been specified below, to help you format them properly.

setup:
   - type: skip
     path: test
     attribute: value
