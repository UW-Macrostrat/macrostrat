# Macrostrat system

This repository attempts to bring together many independent components of the
Macrostrat system into an environment where they can be containerized and smoothly
managed. Its goal is to provide a system for experimenting with images and building production
versions. Ultimately, Docker should be the preferred strategy for deploying the contents
of this repository.
