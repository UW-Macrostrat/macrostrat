# Ad-hoc data management scripts

This directory contains ad-hoc SQL scripts that can be run on demand.
These scripts generally modify data in a way that makes them less suited to be
run as schema migrations, but they are useful for one-off tasks.

TODO: we'd like to integrate this more closely into the migrations system in the future
