UpperSCRV,,"Geologic Map of Surficial and Basin Deposits of the Upper Santa Cruz Valley, Southeastern Arizona",Philip A. Pearthree,2025,https://data.azgs.arizona.edu/api/v1/collections/ADGM-1764867637877-752,https://data.azgs.arizona.edu/api/v1/collections/ADGM-1764867637877-752,CC BY-NC-SA 4.0,DGM-294,Santa Cruz Valley; Santa Cruz River; Sonoita Creek; Potrero Creek; Sopori Wash; piedmont; Holocene; late Pleistocene; Quaternary; Santa Rita Mountains; mines,English,"This surficial geologic map covers the upper Santa Cruz Valley between the southern edge of the Tucson 30’ x 60’ quadrangle mapped previously (Pearthree et al., 2024) and the international border with Mexico. The map depicts the distribution of surficial and basin deposits in some detail, whereas all bedrock within the map area is grouped in one unit. The map area is entirely within the watershed of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River and its principal tributaries of Sonoita Creek, Potrero Creek, and Sopori Wash. Incision by axial streams and related basin dissection vary dramatically across the map area. In the south, the Santa Cruz River and tributaries have eroded deeply into basin deposits during the Quaternary. The swath of axial valley alluvium is relatively narrow; adjacent piedmonts on either side of the valley are covered with tributary deposits ranging in age from Holocene to early Pleistocene, and eroded basin deposits are extensively exposed. The Santa Cruz River and its tributaries are only modestly incised in the northern part of the map area. Holocene and late Pleistocene tributary deposits are very extensive, covering most piedmont areas, with older Pleistocene remnants confined to upper piedmont areas. Many normal faults that cut Quaternary or Neogene deposits are depicted on the map. Most of the faults are part of the Santa Rita fault zone, which stretches from near the northern margin of the map to Josephine Canyon, on the piedmont between the Santa Cruz River and the Santa Rita Mountains. This fault zone was most recently active in the late Pleistocene, and there is evidence for recurrent fault movement in the Quaternary (Pearthree and Calvo, 1987). No definitive evidence of Quaternary activity has been discovered along the other faults depicted on the map, but they do displace Neogene basin deposit (units QNs and Ns). Several large mines focused primarily on copper have been developed on the west side of the Santa Cruz River. In addition, there are several aggregate mines situated in Santa Cruz River deposits. Mines, tailings, and related surface disturbance, landfills, water recharge facilities, and most of the Interstate Highway 19 corridor are mapped as “disturbed”. This geologic map was funded in part by the U.S. Geological Survey National Cooperative Geological Mapping Program under STATEMAP award G23AC00556. The views and conclusion obtained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the U.S. Government."

The southern portion of the quadrangle consists of the northern Hualapai Mountains, while the northern portion is mainly low-relief alluvial plains. Rattlesnake Hill is the only feature of significant topographic relief north of Interstate 40, which trends roughly east-west through the quadrangle. An important watershed divide trends northwest from near the southeastern corner to the west-central portion of the quadrangle. Southwest of this divide is the Thirteenmile Wash-Sacramento Wash watershed, which in the quadrangle is drained by Sawmill Canyon. This stream system is integrated with the Colorado River. Northeast of the watershed divide is the Frees Wash subdivision of the Red Lake Playa watershed. Red Lake Playa is the low point of Hualapai Valley, and is primarily an internally drained watershed not integrated with the Colorado River. The main drainages in this watershed within the quadrangle are Frees Wash and Hualapai Canyon. Average annual rainfall in the quadrangle ranges from 8 to 16 inches, with the higher precipitation values concentrated over the Hualapai Mountains in the southern portion of the quadrangle. The bedrock geology of this quadrangle includes Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks that experienced migmatization during the emplacement of a Mesoproterozoic megacrystic granite. Additionally, the Neogene Peach Spring Tuff, and other Neogene lava flows are exposed in the southwestern part of the map and dip gently WNW.

The geology within the quadrangle is diverse, including Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, Cretaceous to Paleogene (Laramide) intrusive and volcanic rocks, Neogene volcanic rocks, intrusive rocks and basin deposits, and extensive Quaternary surficial deposits cover much of the map area. The quadrangle includes the growing community of Safford (about 10,000 people) and numerous smaller communities. The Safford Mine in the northern part of the quadrangle is an open-pit mine operated by Freeport-McMoran, extracting primarily copper from the San Juan, Dos Pobres, and Lone Star ore bodies. Deposits of the Gila River supply abundant, high-quality aggregate for the region. A variety of published map data was utilized to construct this Safford 1:100,000-scale quadrangle. Substantial portions of the quadrangle had been mapped previously at 1:24,000 or 1:48,000 scale by geologists with the Arizona Geological Survey or the U.S. Geological Survey. In these areas, the large-scale mapping was generalized and modestly reinterpreted. Other parts of the quadrangle had been mapped at smaller scale by U.S. Geological Survey geologists. This mapping was used for the bedrock compilation, but surficial and basin deposits were remapped as the current map was developed.

Geologic mapping was based on both field observations and interpretation of aerial photographs and soil surveys. Mapping of Quaternary surficial deposits was initially done by Huckleberry, whereas final mapping and interpretation of surficial deposits and bedrock areas was completed by Leighty. A limited amount of unpublished Arizona Geological Survey mapping (by Steve Reynolds and Mike Grubensky for the Phoenix North 1:100,000 scale geologic map) augmented the new mapping of this report. Also, the mapping of Tertiary rocks by Jagiello (1987) is locally similar to that of this report.

The geomorphology of the area is dominated by the Santa Cruz River and several large tributaries whose courses traverse broad, low-relief valley floors, adjacent broad, gently sloping piedmonts, and generally narrow, northerly elongate mountain ranges. All or parts of at least 10 mountain ranges with diverse geology are covered by this map, but surficial deposits of various types cover about 3/4 of the map area. The Santa Cruz River crosses from the south-central edge to the northwest corner of the map area, passing between the Samaniego Hills and Picacho Peak in the south and exiting west of the Sacaton Mountains. Santa Rosa Wash and its tributaries in the southwest part of the map flow northward to the river. The eastern 1/3 of the map is primarily bedrock of the Tortolita Mountains and Ninetysix Hills and broad, westward-sloping piedmonts covered primarily with variably dissected Pleistocene alluvial fan deposits and lesser amounts of Holocene deposits along or near modern washes. Valley floor deposits associated with regional drainages dominate the western 2/3 of the map. Bedrock mountains have relatively small footprints; their adjacent alluvial piedmonts are covered primarily by late Pleistocene and Holocene tributary deposits and are only locally dissected, typically near the mountain ranges. Generally fine-grained Holocene deposits are widespread on the broad valley floors, but slightly higher late to middle Pleistocene relict basin floor deposits are also laterally extensive. Surficial geologic units range from Holocene stream channel and floodplain deposits along the Santa Cruz River and its larger tributaries and channel, floodplain, and alluvial fan deposits throughout the piedmonts, to remnant early Pleistocene alluvial fan deposits capping very well-rounded Neogene basin fill in a few locations near mountain fronts. Channel deposits and terraces are relatively narrow in the proximal piedmont where incised into higher-standing older alluvium. These deposits are much more laterally extensive in the lower relief mid- and distal-piedmont. Carbonate and clay accumulation in Holocene piedmont deposits is modest to minimal. Late and middle Pleistocene alluvial fan and terrace deposits typically have desert pavement, rock varnish, argillic horizons, and soil carbonate accumulation. Some relict early Pleistocene deposits are littered with carbonate fragments from an eroding petrocalcic horizon. Basin fill alluvium is exposed in deeply dissected, very well-rounded hills in the proximal piedmont. Some of these deposits are capped by early to middle Pleistocene alluvium along the ridge crest. Bedrock geology includes rocks ranging in age from Paleoproterozoic to early Miocene. The Paleoproterozoic Pinal Schist, along with Mesoproterozoic plutonic rocks that intrude it, are exposed in ranges throughout the area. Sedimentary rocks of Mesoproterozoic and Paleozoic age overlie these crystalline basement rocks in the Slate Mountains, Tat Momoli Mountains, and Vaiva Hills. Cretaceous to mid-Cenozoic intrusive rocks crop out in the Tortolita Mountains, Suizo Mountains, Durham Hills, Desert Peak, Picacho Mountains, and Sacaton Mountains. Late Oligocene to early Miocene basaltic to trachtic lava flows and clastic sedimentary rocks are exposed north of the Tortolita Mountains and in the Samaniego Hills, Picacho Peak, Sawtooth Mountains, Tat Momoli Mountains, and Vaiva Hills. Late Cretaceous to Oligocene plutons and their country rocks in the eastern part of the map occupy the northwestern part of the Catalina-Rincon metamorphic core complex (Davis, 1980; Dickinson, 1991). They form culminations that are small in comparison with the major exposures of the core complex in the Santa Catalina and Rincon Mountains, southeast of the map area. These crystalline rocks are variably foliated and lineated, ranging from massive to gneissic to mylonitic. Mylonitic foliation and lineation are developed in the structurally highest rocks, and asymmetric shear fabrics are predominantly indicative of top-to-WSW shearing (Spencer et al., 2002; Ferguson et al., 2002; Richard et al., 1999, 2002). The crystalline rocks of the metamorphic core complex lie in the footwalls of detachment faults that are associated with the Catalina detachment (e.g., Dickinson, 1991) and along which they were exhumed in the late Oligocene to early Miocene (Spencer et al., 2022). In this map area the detachment system is represented by the Guild Wash, Suizo, and Picacho Peak detachments and subsidiary low-angle normal faults. Late Oligocene to early Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks are in the hanging wall of the detachment system. Proterozoic rocks occupy structural positions in both the footwall and the hanging wall."

Thus, the knowledge of the distribution and character of bedrock and surficial deposits is important to make informed decisions concerning management of the land and its resources. Geologic mapping of the Cave Creek quadrangle is related to other previous and ongoing mapping projects of urban fringe areas located to the north and northeast of the Phoenix metropolitan area (figure 1). Access for most parts of the Cave Creek quadrangle is excellent (figure 2). Numerous paved roads (e.g., Scottsdale Road, Cave Creek Road, Carefree Highway) and well-maintained dirt roads make much of the quadrangle highly accessible. Access within the Cave Creek Recreation area is limited to the established trail system, unless permission from the park rangers is obtained. Building construction is active across the area, and several large, gated housing developments restrict the access to previously accessible areas; permission is required to enter several of these developments (e.g., Desert Mountain). Geologic mapping of bedrock in the quadrangle was based on field mapping, whereas surficial mapping was based upon both field observations and interpretation of aerial photographs.

The upper Gila River runs across the quadrangle from southeast to northwest. The communities of Duncan and Franklin, Arizona, and Virden, New Mexico lie within the quadrangle. Latest Pliocene and early Quaternary basin fill deposits are extensively exposed in the Duncan map area, with a relatively thin veneer of Quaternary piedmont alluvium. The Gila River is incised into basin fill and river deposits are relatively thin. Oligocene to Miocene volcanic bedrock is isolated to the far northeastern portion of the quadrangle. Deposits derived from the mountains grade downslope to major tributaries to the Gila River, forming sizable alluvial fans of various ages on piedmonts, especially along Carlisle and Moore canyons north of the river, and Railroad Wash between the Peloncillo Mountains and Pearson Mesa south of the river. Pearson Mesa is capped by ancestral Gila River gravels and now represents an inverted topographic remnant elevated 120 m above the modern river. Quaternary faults cut across Pearson Mesa in part of the Duncan quadrangle, discussed further in the Round Mountain quadrangle text. Previous studies of basin fill deposits in the Duncan area were mapped and defined as the Gila Formation, a broad classification of coarse-grained deposits formed in closed basins in the southwest, and locally between the Peloncillo Mountains to the southwest and Burro and Big Lue mountains to the northeast (Morrison, 1965). These deposits were originally assigned a Tertiary age, and later revised to include late Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs based on paleontologic (Tomida, 1985; Morgan and Lucas, 2000; Morgan et al., 2005) and magnetostratigraphic (Tomida, 1985) studies from fossil quarries at Pearson Mesa. Work by Reid and Buffler (2005) contributed numerous stratigraphic, sedimentologic and facies distribution maps north of the mapping area, which were incorporated into analysis of basin stratigraphy in this report and map. Geologic mapping, stratigraphy and geochronology of basin-fill deposition and integration of the upper Gila River is further summarized in Gootee et al. (2022). Basin fill deposits in the Duncan area are informally designated as the ‘Duncan beds’ based new mapping."

Mapping continued in 2021-2022 with the Pilgrim Wash, Bottleneck Wash, and Dean Peak quadrangles, the southern half of the Tom Brown Canyon quadrangle, and the eastern half of the Hibernia Peak quadrangle. The Aquarius and Hualapai Mountains are underlain by Paleoproterozoic gneiss intruded by Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic plutonic rocks. In the Hualapai Mountains, these rocks have been intruded locally by late Cretaceous plutons and several spatially extensive dike swarms. Two plutons in the southern Hualapai Mountains, and at least some of the dikes, are associated with weakly developed hydrothermal alteration and mineralization inferred as being related to a porphyry copper system. On both sides of Big Sandy Valley, the plutonic and metamorphic basement rocks are overlain unconformably by two successions of predominantly sedimentary basin-fill deposits. The lower succession, the Tule Wash formation (informally defined in the Tule Wash quadrangle), together with its basement has been dissected and tilted by Basin-and-Range normal faults. This succession and the older rocks are overlain unconformably by the Big Sandy Formation, which is generally undeformed.

It is one of the highest, most rugged areas in central Arizona. Four Peaks forms part of the high ridge that forms the backbone of the southern Mazatzal Mountains. The Four Peaks quadrangle ranges in elevation from about 2400 feet along Bumblebee Creek in the northeast comer of the map up to 7657 feet at Brown's Peak. Most of the region is extremely rugged and difficult to access. The Four Peaks Road, which branches off State Route 87 at Sugarloaf Mountain (west of the map area), is a good 2-wheel-drive dirt road. The Four Peaks Road becomes the El Oso Road on the east side of the high divide, which is also passable with a 2-wheel drive vehicle. On the east side of the range the road to Three Bar Cabin is also 2-wheel-drive accessible, but the road to Big Oak Flat is very rocky and narrow. The ridge road branching northward from the El Oso Road north to Big Pine Flat is also good, though about 1 mile farther north of Big Pine Flat it becomes rough even for a 4-wheel-drive vehicle. The quadrangle covers a wide range of elevations and bio-zones. On the southwest and northeast comers of the region below about 4000 feet Sonoran Desert vegetation dominates, and includes plants such as saguaro, palo verde, cholla and prickly pear cactus, among others. Above about 4000 feet Sonoran Desert vegetation gives way to dense chaparral vegetation including scrub oak, manzanita, desert mahogany, sumac, and others. The thick chaparral blankets the landscape and creates a nearly impenetrable, dense thicket. This was a major obstacle to detailed mapping in the higher elevations. Fortunately, (or unfortunately) the 1996 Lone Fire that originated near Pigeon Spring burned most of the thick chaparral from the Brushy Basin southward to beyond the southern boundary of the map. In many places dense, ghostly woodlands remained, composed of the charred skeletons of trees and shrubs. Mapping for this project was carried out mostly during May 1997, May 1998, and April-May 1999, during which time I observed the rapid regrowth of the vegetation. Conifer forests grow on a few of the north-facing slopes near Four Peaks and Buckhorn Mountain. During this study most of the trees in these patches of forest were burned.

The geology within the quadrangle is diverse, including Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, Cretaceous to Paleogene (Laramide) intrusive and rocks, and Neogene volcanic rocks, sedimentary deposits, and intrusive rocks. Late Neogene and Quaternary basin and surficial deposits cover most of the map area. The quadrangle encompasses a wide range of surficial deposits and associated landforms, including alluvial fans, terraces, tributary and distributary channel networks and overbank areas, and colluvium and regolith. The largest fluvial systems, the Hassayampa and Agua Fria Rivers, traverse the quadrangle from north to south before joining the Salt-Gila River system south of the map boundary. Both rivers deposited extensive, coarse-grained, lithologically diverse alluvial fans in the early Pleistocene where the rivers enter Hassayampa Valley and the northwestern Phoenix basin. Similar old river deposits are preserved as high terraces to the southern edge of the map. Both rivers have downcut deeply into their early Pleistocene deposits, with the amount of incision decreasing to the south. Younger river deposits are generally confined to valleys incised into the older deposits; in sum, the river deposits form relatively narrow north-south bands across the map. Deposits of sizable tributary systems, including Cave and Skunk Creeks, New River, and Jackrabbit Wash, and basin-floor deposits between larger drainages (units Qyr, Qir, and Qor), cover substantial portions of the eastern and west-central map areas. These deposits are moderately diverse lithologically. Piedmonts and axial valley areas away from the major rivers are minimally to moderately incised. Middle and upper piedmont areas typically are covered primarily by intermediate age alluvial fan and terrace deposits, with a few remnants of older deposits and small young alluvial fans and strips of younger deposits. Young deposits cover most lower piedmonts. Thin hillslope colluvium, weathered bedrock regolith, and small alluvial fans cover most lower slopes of bedrock hills and mountains. The oldest bedrock units in the quadrangle are Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary and metaplutonic rocks. West of Lake Pleasant, Proterozoic rocks are dominated by medium-high grade amphibolites (Xam), metasediments (Xms), and deformed granites (Xg), with some metavolcanic units in the southern Hieroglyphic Mountains (Xmv, Xra). East and southeast of Lake Pleasant, lower grade metavolcanic and metasedimentary assemblages predominate (Xra, Xvmi, Xq). Mesoproterozoic plutonic rocks (YXg) are only exposed in the Pyramid Peak area. Cretaceous granite-diorite plutons (Kg, Kgd, Kd) and related hypabyssal intrusives (Ki) comprise large parts of the Vulture Mountains. A younger Paleocene-Eocene pluton (PKg) is overprinted by Miocene core-complex related deformation fabrics on the east side of the White Tank Mountains with the associated detachment fault mostly concealed on the west side of the range. The youngest Neogene-Paleogene plutonic rocks are exposed in the Belmont and White Tank Mountains (Ng, Pg). Oligocene-Miocene felsic and mafic volcanic rocks, with associated sedimentary rocks are exposed across the Phoenix North quadrangle. West of Lake Pleasant thick rhyolite flows, domes and volcanoclastic rocks (Nr, Nt) constructed upon a lower basalt (NPb) are pervasively cut by northwest-striking low and high-angle normal faults. Rhyolitic dikes and hypabyssal instrusives (Ni) related to rhyolitic volcanism are widespread in the Vulture Mountains. East of Lake Pleasant upper and lower basalt flow units (Nbl, Nbu) with intervening volcanogenic sediments (Nsv) are generally neither faulted nor tilted. </abstract> <purpose>This geologic map was funded in part by the U.S. Geological Survey National Cooperative Geological Mapping Program under STATEMAP award G22AC00365, 2022.

The Aquarius and Hualapai Mountains are underlain by Paleoproterozoic gneiss intruded by Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic plutonic rocks. In the Hualapai Mountains, these rocks have been intruded locally by late Cretaceous plutons and several spatially extensive dike swarms. Two plutons in the southern Hualapai Mountains, and at least some of the dikes, are associated with weakly developed hydrothermal alteration and mineralization inferred as being related to a porphyry copper system. On both sides of Big Sandy Valley, the plutonic and metamorphic basement rocks are overlain unconformably by two successions of predominantly sedimentary basin-fill deposits. The lower succession, the Tule Wash formation (informally defined in the Tule Wash quadrangle), together with its basement has been dissected and tilted by Basin-and-Range normal faults. This succession and the older rocks are overlain unconformably by the Big Sandy Formation, which is generally undeformed. River, tributary, and fan deposits record the history of basin filling and subsequent dissection due to integration into the larger Bill Williams River watershed."

The quadrangle straddles Greenlee County in easternmost Arizona and Hidalgo County in westernmost New Mexico. Latest Pliocene and early Quaternary basin fill deposits are extensively exposed in the Round Mountain map area, with a relatively thin veneer of Quaternary piedmont alluvium. Neogene volcanic bedrock is exposed along the western part of the map area. Deposits derived from the mountains grade downslope from major tributaries into Railroad Wash, forming sizable alluvial fans of various ages on piedmonts, especially along Gillispie Canyon Wash and Round Mtn Draw on both sides of Bobcat Hills, Horseshoe Wash from the south, and Thompson, Dagger, and Stanford draws from Pearson and Lordsburg mesas to the east. Pearson Mesa is capped by ancestral Gila River gravels and now represents an inverted topographic remnant elevated 120 m above the modern river. Previous studies of basin fill deposits in the Duncan area were mapped and defined as the Gila Formation, a broad classification of coarse-grained deposits formed in closed basins in the southwest, and locally between the Peloncillo Mountains to the southwest and Burro and Big Lue mountains to the northeast (Morrison, 1965). These deposits were originally assigned a Tertiary age, and later revised to include late Pliocene and early Pleistocene epochs based on paleontologic (Tomida, 1985; Morgan and Lucas, 2000; Morgan et al., 2005) and magnetostratigraphic (Tomida, 1985) studies from fossil quarries at Pearson Mesa. Work by Reid and Buffler (2005) contributed numerous stratigraphic, sedimentologic and facies distribution maps north of the mapping area which were incorporated into analysis of basin stratigraphy in this report and map. Geologic mapping, stratigraphy and geochronology of basin-fill deposition and integration of the upper Gila River is further summarized in Gootee et al. (2022). Basin fill deposits in the Duncan area are informally designated as the ‘Duncan beds’ based on new mapping."

Two plutons in the southern Hualapai Mountains, and at least some of the dikes, are associated with weakly developed hydrothermal alteration and mineralization inferred as being related to a porphyry copper system. On both sides of Big Sandy Valley, the plutonic and metamorphic basement rocks are overlain unconformably by two successions of predominantly sedimentary basin-fill deposits. The lower succession, the Tule Wash formation (informally defined in the Tule Wash quadrangle), together with its basement has been dissected and tilted by Basin-and-Range normal faults. This succession and the older rocks are overlain unconformably by the Big Sandy Formation, which is generally undeformed. River, tributary, and fan deposits record the history of basin filling and subsequent dissection due to integration into the larger Bill Williams River watershed."

Mylonitization of lower-plate crystalline rocks was the result of ductile shearing along the down-dip projection of the Buckskin-Rawhide detachment fault early in its movement history. Two assemblages of rocks are preserved in the upper plate of the Buckskin-Rawhide detachment fault in the Swansea-Copper Penny area: (l) Pre-Tertiary rocks, especially Paleozoic and Mesozoic metasedimentary rocks, are complexly deformed and have undergone greenschist-facies metamorphism.

It defines the northern Big Sandy River watershed and northern Big Sandy Valley, which is the surface expression of Big Sandy basin. In this region, Big Sandy Valley is bordered on the west by the Peacock Mountains and on the east by the Cottonwood Mountains and the informally named Red Tank Range splits the drainage area into two subbasins – western and eastern. The oldest rocks in the quadrangle are Paleoproterozoic paragneiss, schist, and amphibolite, intruded by granitic rocks of probable Mesoproterozoic age, which together form the basement of the Red Tank Range and Peacock Mountains. Alkali-rich volcanic domes and flows ranging in composition from trachybasalt to trachydacite unconformably rest on Proterozoic crystalline rocks in these ranges. Proterozoic and Miocene rocks are cut by numerous north-striking high-angle normal faults with up to 100 m of displacement, showing faulting is younger than, at least, middle Miocene (Na2 unit). The concealed Red Tank Range bounding fault in the western subbasin has an estimated throw of ~800 m. Faulting has continued into the Quaternary, as shown by one new N-S trending fault south of Red Tank Range, identified through this mapping. The Late Miocene to Pliocene Big Sandy Formation (conglomerate and sandy lithofacies) and a thin veneer of Quaternary surficial deposits unconformably overlie all bedrock and are extensively exposed along drainages and piedmont areas in the south and central portions of the quadrangle. Big Sandy Formation conglomerate lithofacies is dominated by locally derived Proterozoic crystalline and Neogene volcanic rocks and represent alluvial fan aggradation during the late Miocene to Pliocene. The Holocene alluvial system defines the modern drainage network, which includes Peacock Wash (western subbasin) and Big Sandy Wash (eastern subbasin)."

The quadrangle is bounded by latitudes 33°37'30""N and 33°45'00''N, and longitudes 112°00'00""W and 112°07'30""W. The area south of the Union Hills has become highly urbanized during the last few decades and is still undergoing rapid population growth. Thus, the knowledge of the distribution and character of bedrock and surficial deposits is important to make informed decisions concerning management of the land and its resources. Geologic mapping of the Biscuit Flat Quadrangle is related to other 1:24,000 scale mapping projects in and around the Phoenix metropolitan area (Figure 1; see map plate). Geologic mapping of bedrock in the quadrangle was based on field mapping, whereas surficial mapping was based upon field observations, and the interpretation of aerial photographs and soils maps. The respective mapping coverage accomplished by each author (i.e., Holloway and Leighty) is shown on the map plate. A limited amount of unpublished Arizona Geological Survey mapping (by Steve Reynolds and Mike Grubensky for the Phoenix North 1:100,000 scale geologic map) augmented the new mapping of this report. Also, the 1 :24,000 scale mapping of Tertiary rocks by Jagiello (1987) is locally similar to that of this report.

The geomorphology is dominated by the watershed of the Santa Cruz River flowing northward through the center of the map area, with its tributaries of Cienega Creek and the Rillito River in the Tucson Valley and Brawley Wash in Avra Valley. The San Pedro River, east of the Rincon and Santa Catalina Mountains, constitutes a separate watershed along the eastern edge of the map area. Incision by axial streams and related basin dissection vary dramatically across the map area. In the east, the San Pedro River and tributaries have eroded deeply into basin deposits during the Quaternary. The swath of axial valley alluvium is relatively narrow and piedmonts are covered with tributary deposits ranging in age from Holocene to middle and early Pleistocene. The Santa Cruz River and its large tributaries of the Tucson basin are less incised, although piedmonts on the basin margins are moderately to deeply dissected. The broad valley floor is covered by deposits ranging in age from Holocene to early Pleistocene, with early to middle Pleistocene deposits being most extensive. Valley axes in the western part of the map drained by Brawley and Aguirre Washes are broad and minimally incised. These areas are covered by generally fine-grained Holocene floodplain deposits and low late to middle Pleistocene terraces. Holocene and late Pleistocene deposits cover most piedmont areas, with older Pleistocene remnants confined to upper piedmont areas. The oldest rocks in the Rincon, Santa Catalina, and Tortolita Mountains in the eastern third to half of the map area consist of Paleoproterozoic Pinal Schist and plutonic rocks intruded by Mesoproterozoic plutonic rocks and overlain rocks of the Apache Group. These basement rocks are overlain by Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and thin Jurassic-Triassic sedimentary rocks that underly the latest Jurassic to early Cretaceous Bisbee Group. Cretaceous and Cenozoic plutons intrude this stratigraphic framework. These rocks were exhumed along the Catalina detachment between ~26-17 Ma producing a well-developed mylonitic fabric with S/C fabrics with top-to-the-southwest sense of shear and sedimentary rocks filling hanging-wall half-grabens. The Tucson Mountains in the center of the map area represent a Cretaceous caldera that erupted the Cat Mountain Tuff, with the Amole pluton potentially constituting a resurgent ring intrusion. The Roskruge and Waterman Mountains are dominated by the Tuff of Sharp Peak (which may be correlative with the Cat Mountain Tuff) but also host several Cretaceous and Cenozoic intrusions and late Cenozoic basalt flows. The Silver Bell Mountains, in the northwestern part of the map, represent another Cretaceous caldera which erupted the Confidence Peak Tuff and were in turn intruded by a suite of late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (“Laramide”) intrusive rocks that formed the Silver Bell porphyry copper deposit. Mid- to late Cenozoic volcanic rocks overlie the Cretaceous rocks."

Surficial deposits cover most of the map area. Fluvial incision is much less dramatic in this quadrangle than in adjacent areas to the east and north, thus exposures of surficial and basin deposits are quite limited. Deposits derived from the mountains grade downslope to axial drainages, forming sizable alluvial fans of various ages on piedmonts, especially in Whitlock Valley. Broad parts of the map are covered by locally-derived hillslope deposits; on the western flanks of the Peloncillo Mountains, evidence of young debris flow activity is common."

Most of the central and western portions of the quadrangle are within the corporate boundaries of the City of Scottsdale. In the east the region includes the upper reaches of Camp Creek and the lower-crustal xenolith-bearing latite lavas of Blue Mountain. Topographic relief is low through most of the map area, with a few hills rising above a broad pediment formed on granitic rocks. The map that accompanies this report characterizes the bedrock and surficial geology of the Wildcat Hill quadrangle, and this report summarizes the geology and geologic hazards of the quadrangle. Mapping of bedrock in the quadrangle was based primarily on extensive field investigations. Surficial geologic mapping was based both on field observations and interpretation of black-and-white, 1:48,000-scale aerial photographs (dated 9-17-92) and color, 1:24,000-scale aerial photographs (dated 6-11-88) obtained from the Tonto National Forest.

The Bouse Hills consist of four rock assemblages (Fig. 2), as follows: (1) Proterozoic crystalline rocks, (2) moderately to steeply tilted Oligocene(?) to lower Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, (3) a Miocene pluton and related dikes, and (4) flat-lying to gently tilted Miocene volcanic and minor sedimentary rocks. Assemblages (1) and (2) were tilted by early Miocene rotational normal faulting that was widespread in the Basin and Range province (Spencer and Reynolds, 1989). In the Bouse Hills, tilting was probably related to movement on the Plomosa detachment fault which projects beneath the Bouse Hills from the west (Scarborough and Meader, 1989). Manganese and barite mineral deposits are mineralogically distinct, and fluid-inclusion data indicate that they were derived from aqueous fluids with different salinities. These deposits are confined to the Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks.

Preparation of this report included research of previous geologic work and geologic mapping. Mapping was done directly on a topographic base map at a scale of 1:24,000 and aerial photos were used as a field mapping aid. Field work was conducted between September 12, 1991 and May 1, 1992. The Sierra Estrella is a northwest-trending mountain range consisting of a single compact ridge that is 38 km in length, and 5 to 7 km wide. The base of the range varies in elevation from 559 m above sea level near the confluence of the Gila and Salt Rivers in the north, to 788 m near the Gila River Indian Reservation boundary in the south. The highest elevations in the Sierra Estrella are an unnamed peak at 1375 m in the north-central part of the range and Montezuma Peak at 1323 m. This study covers approximately 165 km2 of the Sierra Estrella. Approximately one-quarter of the study area lies within the boundaries of the Gila River Indian Reservation, and it was necessary to obtain a permit from the Gila River Indian Community Council to visit this area. The topography is extremely rugged and irregular, making the area accessible only on foot. However several unimproved dirt roads do extend to the base of the range on the east and west sides.

Along with the northerly adjacent Payson Basin, Tonto Basin is bounded on the west by a major east-side-down normal fault that accomodates at least 3,000' of displacement. In the Payson basin, the basin-bounding fault was named Payson fault (Muehlberger, 1990) and it forms the abrupt, east-facing escarpment of the Mazatzal Mountains. The western basin-bounding fault of Tonto Basin is also referred to as Payson fault, even though there is an abrupt change of strike where the two basins merge (Figure 1). The eastern margin of both basins is defined by a gentle, west-dipping, depositional unconformity with Proterozoic rocks of the Sierra Ancha (Martin, 1990; Mayes, 1990). Tonto Basin is filled with Miocene and younger mudstone and conglomerate that in general dip gently to the west. Locally along the western margin of the Tonto Basin and in the center of Payson Basin (Muehlberger, 1988), an older sequence of east-tilted conglomerates are present suggesting a complex structural history along the Payson fault. A sequence of Pliocene and younger conglomerate and mudstone in the Payson basin overlap the Payson fault (Muehlberger, 1988), and are probably equivalent with a sequence of flatlying, post-tectonic, younger Tertiary conglomerates in the Tonto Basin which also bury the Payson fault.

The valleys are deeply filled with alluvium that has eroded from adjacent mountains during the last 10 My. This aggradation has been driven by tectonism and climate change, although regional tectonic stability within the last 5 My suggests that climate change is the more recent dominant driving force (Morrison, 1985). Climatic fluctuations between relatively wet and dry conditions have resulted in pulses of aggradation producing a mosaic of different aged alluvial deposits in piedmont areas. Urban development on piedmonts, especially in the Phoenix Basin, has created a need to better understand the distribution and nature of these deposits. Surficial geologic maps characterize and distinguish different piedmont deposits on the basis of age and genesis. Such information provides baseline data for evaluating geologic hazards potential (e.g., Pearthree, 1991), locating possible source areas for industrial minerals (e.g., Wellendorf et aI., 1986), and determining locations favorable for groundwater recharge (e.g., Huckleberry, 1994). Moreover, these maps are also useful for assessing the potential for buried cultural resources and providing insight into local geologic history and landscape evolution. This report presents the results of surficial geologic mapping in the Wittmann and Hieroglyphic Mountains SW 7.5' quadrangles located northwest of metropolitan Phoenix (Figure 1). The project area includes segments of U.S. Highway 60, State Route 79, and the Central Arizona Project Canal, and is contiguous to the south with the White Tanks Mountain piedmont area previously mapped by Field and Pearthree (1991).

The valleys are deeply filled with alluvium that has eroded from adjacent mountains during the last 10 My. This aggradation has been driven by tectonism and climate change, although regional tectonic stability within the last 5 My suggests that climate change is the more recent dominant driving force (Morrison, 1985). Climatic fluctuations between relatively wet and dry conditions have resulted in pulses of aggradation producing a mosaic of different aged alluvial deposits in piedmont areas. Urban development on piedmonts, especially in the Phoenix Basin, has created a need to better understand the distribution and nature of these deposits. Surficial geologic maps characterize and distinguish different piedmont deposits on the basis of age and genesis. Such information provides baseline data for evaluating geologic hazards potential (e.g., Pearthree, 1991), locating possible source areas for industrial minerals (e.g., Wellendorf et aI., 1986), and determining locations favorable for groundwater recharge (e.g., Huckleberry, 1994). Moreover, these maps are also useful for assessing the potential for buried cultural resources and providing insight into local geologic history and landscape evolution. This report presents the results of surficial geologic mapping in the Wittmann and Hieroglyphic Mountains SW 7.5' quadrangles located northwest of metropolitan Phoenix (Figure 1).
