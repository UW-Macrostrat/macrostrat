Slightly more than half of the bedrock in the eastern Gila Bend Mountains is composed of granitic rocks, mainly located in the eastern and northern part of the map area. Except for a few scattered exposures, the Tertiary continental clastic and volcanic rocks crop out in the southwest part of the map area. The eastern Gila Bend Mountains were mapped with funds provided to the Arizona Geological Survey by the U.S. Geological Survey COGEOMAP program, contract #14-08-001-A0785. Field work was carried out from December, 1990 to February, 1991. This report is part of a digital republication of a 1991 geologic map originally created as part of COGEOMAP, a cooperative geologic mapping project between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Arizona Geological Survey. Preparation for republication was conducted by students from the University of Arizona with financial support from the U.S. Geological Survey, National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (G22AP00222) and included the production of a new GIS geodatabase and a revised map layout. The following text report has not been altered and remains identical to the 1991 original, but there may be situations where unit names, ages, symbology, or other geologic information contained within this report do not match the information presented in the new map layout or GIS geodatabase."
