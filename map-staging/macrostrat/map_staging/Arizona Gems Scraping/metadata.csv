Two map sheets, map scale 1:24,000. This geodatabase is part of a digital reproduction of a 1996 geologic map originally created by the Arizona Geological Survey funded by the Arizona Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey STATEMAP Program Contract#1434-95-A-1353. Preparation for republication was conducted by students from the University of Arizona with financial support from the U.S. Geological Survey, National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (G23AP00215) and included the production of a new GIS geodatabase and a revised map layout. The following text report has not been altered and remains identical to the 1996 original, but there may be situations where unit names, ages, symbology, or other geologic information contained within this report do not match the information presented in the new map layout or GIS geodatabase."

The quadrangle is bounded by latitudes 33°4S'00""N and 33°S2'30''N, and longitudes 112°00'00""W and 1 12°07'30""W. Given its location, the area has become highly urbanized during the last few decades and is still undergoing rapid population growth. Thus, the knowledge of the distribution and character of bedrock and surficial deposits is important to make informed decisions concerning management of the land and its resources. Map includes three cross-sections."

Although these sediments have diverse physical characteristics, origins, and ages, they are generally mapped as generic units (e.g., Qal). This lack of detailed mapping is not unique to Arizona; it is estimated that 80% of the United States is still unmapped at intermediate or detailed scales (Molnia, 1992: 191). With recent developments in geologic dating techniques and improved understanding of weathering processes, there is now greater opportunity to distinguish and map unconsolidated sediments into genetic and temporal units. Recently, concerns in environmental geology have provided the impetus for surficial geologic mapping in Arizona (Demsey, 1989; Jackson, 1990; Field and Pearthree, 1991; Huckleberry, 1992a). These maps are of value to the scientific community because they provide insight into paleoenvironments and geomorphic history (Bull, 1991). More importantly, however, surficial geologic maps "" ... can be applied to land-use management, assessment, and utilization, conservation of natural resources, groundwater management, and environmental protection. II (National Geological Mapping Act of 1992 (Section 2(b»). A recent example of the applied value of surficial geological mapping is the re-evaluation of flood hazards on alluvial fans (Pearthree, 1991).
